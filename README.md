<h1 align="center">Hi There<span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif"/></span> I'm Aria Rouzegar</h1>

<p align="center">I’m a computer engineering student and self-taught developer who treats learning as a daily habit, not a phase. I'm deeply drawn to the way software can solve real-world problems, from small quality-of-life improvements to products that serve and empower many people. I feel at home in the tech ecosystem, and I enjoy turning ideas into practical, reliable applications. <br /> <br /> I'm actively looking to grow alongside dedicated people, contribute as a key player in challenging environments, and keep pushing my technical and professional limits. My goal is to build solutions that are not only technically solid, but also genuinely meaningful to the people who use them.</p>
